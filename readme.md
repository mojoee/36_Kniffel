# Yatzy (Dice Game) for Multiplayer


## Project Description

* This project is a very basic implementation of the famous Yatzy game. The game gives each player a score sheet consisting of different dice combinations. The goal is, to fill this score sheet and to max your score. The game can be played with as many players as you want.
* It does without any additional installations. The only modules used so far are random and collections, which are standard libraries in python.
* In the future, I want to include a more advanced GUI with tkinter or pygame, maybe also a multiplayer mode, where one can comfortably play with other players over the network.

# How to use

To play the game, you need to clone the repository and run the main.py file. Then follow the instructions in the console.



# TODOS

* create a gui to have a better game experience
